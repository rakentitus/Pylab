Python was invented in the late 1980s[42] by Guido van Rossum at 
Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a 
successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[43] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[12] 
Its implementation began in December 1989.[44] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when
 he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life" (BDFL), a title the Python community 
bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker[45] (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled "BDFL-emeritus"). 
In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[46][47]

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, 
reference counting, and Unicode support.[48] Python 3.0, released on 3 December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x[49] and 2.7.x. 
Releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.[50]

Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily 
be forward-ported to Python 3.[51][52] No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it.[53][54] Currently only 3.8 
and later are supported (2023 security issues were fixed in e.g. 3.7.17, the final 3.7.x release[55]). While Python 2.7 and older is officially 
unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. "2.7.18+" (plus 3.9 and 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) "backported security updates".[56]

In 2021 (and again twice in 2022), security updates were expedited, since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7[57]) 
because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution[58] and web-cache poisoning.[59] In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 
3.9.12 were expedited[60] and 3.8.13, because of many security issues.[61] When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series 
(joining the older series 3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[62] On 7 September 2022, four new releases were made due to a potential 
denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.[63][64]

As of October 2023, Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. 
Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.[65]

Python 3.12 adds syntax (and in fact every Python since at least 3.5 adds some syntax) to the language, the new (soft) keyword type (recent releases have added a lot of typing 
support e.g. new type union operator in 3.10), and 3.11 for exception handling, and 3.10 the match and case (soft) keywords, for structural pattern matching statements. 
Python 3.12 also drops outdated modules and functionality, and future versions will too, see below in Development section.

Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.

Since 27 June 2023, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching end-of-life.[66]

Python 3.13 introduced an incremental (shorter pauses for collection in programs with a lot of objects) garbage collector, an experimental JIT compiler,[67] and removals from the C API. 
Some standard library modules, 19 dead batteries, and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, and more will be removed in Python 3.15 and or 3.16.[68] Starting with 3.13, it 
and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half); followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).
